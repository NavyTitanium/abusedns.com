title: Cache Poisoning Attack
weight: 4
---
DNS cache poisoning dupes the resolver into believing that the "pirate" server is
an authoritative server in place of the original server. These attacks capture and divert
queries to another website unbeknownst to users, the danger being that users might
divulge personal data on what they believe to be a bona fide site. The "Kaminsky
flaw" discovered during the summer of 2008 is one such attack that poisons DNS
resolvers

**DNS cache poisoning attack attempts to spoof recursive
DNS server.** The attacker tries to make DNS server accept and
cache malicious DNS data.
