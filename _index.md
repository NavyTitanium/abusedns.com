### Why this website
It is hard to find a documentation that centralize all issues with the DNS protocol. This is an effort to list differents abuses of the protocol, how  they works and how we can protect when possible. This is an on going project and there's room for amelioration, don't hesitate to contact us if you think we should add something!
