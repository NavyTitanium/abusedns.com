title: Denial of Service
weight: 3

Denial of service (DoS) attacks are attempts to make a given service impossible or
very hard to access. Attacks sometimes use brute force (saturating servers by flooding
them with simultaneous queries) or go for a more subtle approach by exhausting a rare
resource on the server.

**Denial of service attacks often aim to make the Internet in
a region paralyzed, or to make some website inaccessible. The
former attacks ISP recursive name servers, while the latter
target domain authorization server.**
