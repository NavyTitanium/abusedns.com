### Overview <a id="chapter-1"></a>

Squatting involves registering a domain name with the deliberate intent of
undermining and profiting from a third party’s rights or in some way harming that
third party. There are many cybersquatting techniques, and the general aim is to steal
the victim’s identity and/or divert traffic away from the victim’s website.
