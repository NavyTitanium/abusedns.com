title: Fast Flux / Double Fast flux
description : "Nice buttons on your page."

Fast flux: In addition to falsifying their IP address, attackers can hide their identity
by using this technique, which relies on fast-changing location-related information to
conceal where the attack is coming from. Variants exist, such as single flux (constantly
changing the address of the web server) and double flux (constantly changing the
address of the web server and the names of the DNS servers).
